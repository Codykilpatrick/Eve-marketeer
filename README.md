## Background information 🚀
Eve Online is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. Players are set in the far future and tasked with piloting spaceships to make money (ISK) and do whatever they desire. Players are able to come together to form corporations, then corporations of like minded players form alliances. Eve online has a completely player driver market, that means everything is created and destroyed within the game with very few external injections.

## Problem description 👨‍💻
Our goal with this project was to create a program that would tell us where to buy an item and where to ship it to maximize profits.

For the volume data download the 5 most recent days from: https://data.everef.net/market-history/2022/
-After doing that you must update the "volumes" list in stationpulls.py with the new CSV files.

## Aditional instructions
- Currently the API for Eve's daily market history is down until further notice so we are stuck using the data from 30OCT22-03NOV22.
- I have submitted a trouble ticket with the respone "We are not sure when the API will be back up.
- The program still works the formula is just slightly skewed due to using old historic data.
